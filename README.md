      ## Truck Routes

## Project Description:

  Truck Routes is a Web app that provides routes for trucks focused on fleet services. Basically if a truck driver needs to go from         point A to Point B and needs to consider the size of the truck, weight, cargo, etc, Truck-Routes will take all these variables into       account and provide the best route.
  This project adds value to truck companies that need to save time and resources when selecting the best rout for cargo deliveries.
